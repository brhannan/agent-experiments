# Wooden Boatbuilding YouTube Channels

Here are some excellent channels for wooden boatbuilding:

## **Sampson Boat Co** (Highly Recommended)
Leo Sampson Goolden's channel documenting the rebuild of a 100-year-old sailing yacht "Tally Ho." Exceptional production quality, detailed explanations of traditional techniques, and very engaging storytelling.

## **Acorn to Arabella**
Leo Goolden's earlier project (before Sampson Boat Co) - building a small wooden boat from scratch. Great for beginners.

## **Tips from a Shipwright**
Louis Sauzedde shares professional shipwright techniques, tips, and traditional boatbuilding methods. Very practical and educational.

## **Tally Ho Rebuild** / **Sampson Boat Co**
(Same as first entry - it's that good!)

## Other Notable Channels:
- **JEM Watercraft** - Small boat building and restoration
- **Sailing Uma** - Includes wooden boat maintenance/repair segments
- **The Shipyard** - Traditional techniques and restorations

**Sampson Boat Co** is generally considered the gold standard for wooden boatbuilding content on YouTube - comprehensive, professional, and beautifully produced.

Cool! Yes, Tally Ho is obviously the correct answer.
